At the time of writing this I have quite little interest in software engineering, it seems like a very lucrative career and definitely something I should understand and be aware of however it doesn't pique my interest to any significant margin. I am happy to be able to take a class on it and the skills to be learned here seem to be quite transferable into other areas of computer science. However, in and of itself the prospect of having to write and revise code for websites and other tools doesn't seem appealing.

 I have to believe that I am somewhat misunderstanding what it means to do software engineering and I hope to learn more about it as the semester goes on. With newfound knowledge I may grow to enjoy the process of designing an application or website and this will become a new point of passion for me.

For now though I look forward to other aspects of the course, chief among those is the opportunity to learn a new programming language. It's another opportunity to check myself and see how well I really know the fundamentals of programming and how well I can apply those fundamentals to a new syntax. It's a chance to look into how the writers of this language chose to solve the inherent problems prevalent in any modern programming language and to analyze why they made such choices. Finally it's an opportunity to see new libraries and look into how people have adapted to the shortcomings of the language and how these might come up in my own code.
