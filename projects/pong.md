summary: "A recreation of the Atari Pong game using Java for a high school coding class"
---
Pong is one of the first video games and was released by Atari in 1972. This version is a recreation using Java's swing graphics manager. My version attempts to recreate the outcome of the Pong game however does not follow the exact same logic since I had the luxury of using a modern day programming language and the libraries that come with that. This was a great introduction into multi threading since the animation system used a thread counter to time the frames and allowed me to get a taste of making graphics with Java's swing package.
