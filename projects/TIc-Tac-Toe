Tic-Tac-Toe is quite a simple game to the extent that from a mathematical standpoint it is a solved game where when played perfectly it should result in a tie every game. In this implementation the player has the option to do a 2 player mode where the user inputs both the X's and the O's and a 1 player version where the user plays versus the computer. My main role was to write the algorithm that the computer would use to make moves in the game. I ended up using an implementation of the Minimax algorithm (the standard for many two player game algorithms) and was able to make a rudimentary "AI" that would result in a tie every game. This project was my first real look into algorithms of any considerable complexity and was a wonderful learning experience. It also was the first time I had to work with other programmers to make something larger than what I could've made on my own at the time.
