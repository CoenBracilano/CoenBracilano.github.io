The goal of this project was to be able to graph any curve I wanted given the equation in slope-intercept form (y=mx+b). The program takes the given string, runs it through a regular expression to obtain the important values like the exponent, the slope, any negative signs, ect. It then calculates some points, plots them on the screen and draws lines between each point to obtain a curve. This project forced me to learn regular expressions on a much deeper level than I had before and really showed me what Java thinks is a String and how it processes Strings.
